# Abstract
  
The paper will describe the trend towards increased complexity in clinical research and the dissapointing ROI with reduced monitoring models.
This paper will briefly summarize the need for a new frame work for designing data quality surveillance capabilties in risk-based monitoring and quality by design models within the clinical research industry.
This paper will propose a ocmprehensive end-to-end frame work for designing a quality surveillance procedures using a modern data science inspired framework
